        Trading foreign exchange on margin carries a high level of risk, and may
        not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work
        against you as well as for you. Before deciding to trade foreign
        exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level
        of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could
        sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore
        you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should
        be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and
        seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any
        doubts.
